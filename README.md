# Example Ansible playbooks for Oracle Linux

This is a collection of ansible playbooks tested on Oracle Linux.

The playbooks were used in PoCs to show integration of several components in the open source software stack of Oracle Linux.

* [OLVM](https://github.com/jromers/ansible-olam/tree/main/olvm): example playbooks using the Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager REST API to create VMs or other VM operations.
* [OSMH](https://github.com/jromers/ansible-olam/tree/main/osmh): example playbook to register an Oracle Linux server at the OS Management Hub management service in Oracle OCI cloud
* [OCI](https://github.com/jromers/ansible-olam/tree/main/oci): example playbooks to create instances in an Oracle cloud OCI compartment
* [Linux](https://github.com/jromers/ansible-olam/tree/main/linux) and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/jromers/ansible-olam/tree/main/kubernetes) are simple playbooks to use in side activities

The playbooks are "as is", a private initiative and are not supported by me or any other person or organisation.
